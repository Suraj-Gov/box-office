[Project Report]()

### Requirements

Python3 & tkinter

### Note for Windows users

You might have issues when creating a file, maybe Windows would block the python program to create a file.
To get around that issue, you need to run the file on powershell with admin rights.

### Note for MacOS users

tkinter currently doesn't allow for button styling on MacOS. To give your buttons a different color, use highlightbgcolor=<hexcode>
You might view dark themed colors if you're using dark theme

### To run the program

```
python3 main.py
```
